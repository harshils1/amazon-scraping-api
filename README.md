# Amazon Web Scraping API:

Hey everyone! You chose to read about my web scraping API repo! Below are some details if you would like to know more about the development process:

# Why did I make this?: 

Learning front-end through React.js, and looking into Full-Stack development, it was time for me to learn about back-end. APIs are used widely, basically in every web application, and
I wanted to dabble in actually creating one. This led me to create an API which web scrapes data from the Amazon.ca website and presents it to a client in JSON. 

# Technologies/Languages Used:

- Express.js 
- Node.js
- Web Scraping API (Scraper)

# Problems/Challenges Faced and What I Learned:

If I am being honest, this API was not too bad to implement and create. Although, I learned A LOT about creating a back-end service. For example, how to display data collected
with JSON, requests and responses, creating endpoints, and most importantly, CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 

# What's next?:

I hope to create more routes, and add more CRUD operations if possible. This is currently deployed on Heroku as a public API, so I also hope to use the data web scraped from 
Amazon in another web application.
