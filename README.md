Hey everyone! You chose to read about my Sudoku Solver repo! Below are some details if you would like to know more about the development process:

# Why did I make this?: 

Learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is necessary in becoming a better programmer. Learning Java, I took it upon myself to apply OOP concepts/principles to a game since 
they usually involve many classes which interact together. All this led to the creation of this Sudoku Solver. To push my limits a bit more, I developed this game using GUI from
Java Swing.

# Technologies/Languages Used:

- Java
- Java Swing

# Problems/Challenges Faced and What I Learned:

If I am being honest, the hardest part was learning about the GUI, not applying OOP principles. Although I learned a lot about polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation, 
making a GUI was pretty difficult. However, through reading documentation and watching tutorials, I was able to create my own GUI with sound effects.


# What's next?:

I have learned quite a lot about OOP concepts and applying it to a game which has a GUI. I think that I am done with this project for now, but if you (the readers) have any
ideas as to what I can add, please let me know!
